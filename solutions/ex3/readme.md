## Content

- The files 3.1. refer to the first and second part of exercise 3.1.
- The file 3.2 contains the solution to the second exercise.
- The file 3.4_naive contains a simple and naive solution to exercise 3.4, while in 3.4_new there is a second solution based on the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
- The file 3.5_module.py contains a module that gives the solution to exercise 5.
- In the sub-directory ex3_6_package I tried to make a package out of the module in exercise 5.
