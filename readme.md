# Crash Python Course

I updated the directory. I created a sub-directory [solutions](solutions) that contains my solutions to the given exercises.

## Content of sub-directory solutions

- [ex1](ex1) contains the solution to the first exercise with a subdirectory of the renamed files.
- There is no directory for exercise 2, but the solution can be found in the collaborative project repository, [Exercise 2](.. /collaborative_project).
- [ex3](ex3) contains a single scripts for each sub-exercise (please note that non exercise 3.3 was given), and a sub-directory for the package of exercise 3.6.
- [ex4](ex4) is to be found the package for the class rational numbers, plus a Jupyter Notebook that contains some tests to verify that everything works properly.

## Content
- [solutions](solutions) see above.
- [lectures](lectures) is a directory containing notebooks and materials used for python lectures (starting from Lec3)
- [exercise0_bash](exercise0_bash) is a walkthrough to better understand bash scripts and batches.
- [exercise1_bash](exercise1_bash) is an assignment in which students have to produce a script for renaming a given collection of files.
- [exercise2_git](exercise2_git) contains instructions to solve the second assignment, in which students should co-operate on the development of a git repository.
- [exercise3_pythonbasics](exercise3_pythonbasics) contains the exercises for the 3rd assignment, in which students should solve some simple mathematical problems by writing python functions and scripts/programs.
- [exercise4_classes](exercise4_classes) contains the text of the last exercise. The assignment wraps up lot (if not everything) we have learned during the lectures and is supposed to push you a bit further.
